# Get an SSH Client Running

We'll be talking to our computers in the cloud using a protocol called SSH (Secure SHell). This lets us start a secure command-line session with a remote machine running Linux or a similar operating system. We SSH via a client on our own computer, but the exact setup varies depending on how this is setup. This can be a little fiddly the first time, so it's worth testing your SSH client beforehand.

### Windows


### Mac (OS X)
Luckily OS X already has an SSH client built-in, so this is easy!
